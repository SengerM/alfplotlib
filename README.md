Functions to use with matplotlib

This intends to be the "evolution" of [nicenquickplotlib](https://github.com/SengerM/nicenquickplotlib). This time the approach will be different. The hard work will be delivered to [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and this collection of functions will operate on already created Matplotlib objects.
